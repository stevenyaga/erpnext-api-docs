Exchange Rate Gain/Loss
=======================

Unrealized vs. Realized Exchange Gain/Loss
------------------------------------------
If a transaction is completed (e.g., an invoice is paid), the resulting gain or loss is considered realized. However, if an invoice is outstanding at the end of an accounting period, any change in value due to exchange rate fluctuations is an unrealized gain or loss.  

1. **Realized Gains/Losses**

Realized gains and losses are profits or losses arising from completed transactions. Unrealized revaluation gains and losses refer to profits or losses that have occurred more commonly known as ‘on paper’, but the relevant closing out transactions have not been completed

Realized gains or losses are the gains or losses on transactions that have been completed. It means that the customer has already settled the invoice prior to the close of the accounting period.

For example, assume that a customer purchased items worth €1,000 from a US seller, and the invoice is valued at $1,100 at the invoice date. The customer settles the invoice 15 days after the date the invoice was sent, and the invoice is valued at $1,200 when converted to US dollars at the current exchange rate.

It means that the seller will have a realized foreign exchange gain of $100 ($1,200–$1,100). The foreign currency gain is recorded in the income section of the income statement.

2. **Unrealized Gains/Losses**

An unrealized exchange rate gain is the potential profit that arises when the value of a foreign currency-denominated asset or liability increases relative to the reporting currency's value, but the transaction has not yet been settled. It's a paper profit that exists until the foreign currency is converted back into the reporting currency or the transaction is otherwise realized. Unrealized gain/loss represents changes in fair value for the period for the related balance sheet line item

Unrealized gains or losses are the gains or losses that the seller expects to earn when the invoice is settled, but the customer has failed to pay the invoice by the close of the accounting period. The seller calculates the gain or loss that would have been sustained if the customer paid the invoice at the end of the accounting period.

For example, if a seller sends an invoice worth €1,000, the invoice will be valued at $1,100 as at the invoice date. Assume that the customer fails to pay the invoice as of the last day of the accounting period, and the invoice is valued at $1,000 at this time.

When preparing the financial statements for the period, the transaction will be recorded as an unrealized loss of $100 since the actual payment is yet to be received. The unrealized gains or losses are recorded in the balance sheet under the owner’s equity section.


Impact on Financial Statements
------------------------------

- Unrealized gains and losses are typically tracked and reported on the balance sheet.
- Realized gains are tracked and reported on the Income Statement

Reversal of unrealized gain or loss
-----------------------------------

When a company holds assets or liabilities denominated in a foreign currency, fluctuations in exchange rates can create gains or losses on paper. These are considered unrealized until the foreign currency is actually converted back to the company's reporting currency. 

Because these gains are not yet realized, they are typically reversed in the subsequent accounting period. This means that a journal entry is made to cancel out the original entry that recorded the unrealized gain. 

An unrealized exchange rate gain reversal is the process of reversing a previous accounting entry that recognized a gain due to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. This reversal typically occurs at the start of a new accounting period, effectively negating the impact of the unrealized gain on the financial statements. This is done because the gain is not yet realized (i.e., the foreign currency has not been converted back to the reporting currency) and is therefore considered temporary and not yet reflected in net income. 

When the transaction is eventually settled (the invoice is paid), the previously unrealized gain or loss is then realized and recorded in the income statement. 

When a company holds assets or liabilities denominated in a foreign currency, fluctuations in exchange rates can create gains or losses on paper. These are considered unrealized until the foreign currency is actually converted back to the company's reporting currency. 

**Purpose of Reversal**

The reversal ensures that unrealized gains or losses do not artificially inflate or deflate the company's profits or losses in a given period.
